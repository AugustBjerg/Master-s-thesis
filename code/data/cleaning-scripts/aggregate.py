# TODO: (tentative) make a dummy column for each variable that holds "Jump", meaning that the variable contains at least one NaN in that timespan

# Determine the granularity

# set aggregation functions for each statistic

# Handle NaN values
    # What only some values are NaN?
    # What if all values are NaN?

# What happens when there are not observations in that time period?
